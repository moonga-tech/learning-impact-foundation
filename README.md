# Learning Impact Foundation

Learning Impact Foundation (a.k.a. Learning Impact Foundation) — a small Next.js site focused on presenting the work and mission of the Learning Impact Foundation.

## Quick start

Install dependencies and run the development server:

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Build and run production locally:

```powershell
npm run build
npm start
# open http://localhost:3000
```

Run with Docker (image built from the included `Dockerfile`):

```powershell
docker build -t learning-impact-foundation.
docker run -p 3000:3000 learning-impact-foundation
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## Project notes

- Logo and favicon placeholders are in `public/images/` (`logo.png`, `favicon-logo.png`). Replace them with final assets if available.
- Primary app files live in the `app/` directory (`layout.js`, `globals.css`, `components/`).

## Contributing

This repo is a straightforward static Next.js site. If you want help updating content, styles, or replacing the logo, open an issue or submit a PR.
